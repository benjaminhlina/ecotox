# ecotox 1.1.0.9000

### New Features 
  * 'ecotox' v1.1.0 is now available  on CRAN 
  * het.sig is a new argument added to the both LC and LT functions 
    it allows for the user to adjust the level of signficance that 
    is used to decided whether or not a hetrogenity factor is used when calculating 
    fiducial condfidnece limits. Default is 0.15 which is the same default used by 
    SPSS 24 when doing a probit analysis. 
  * 'ecotox' v1.1.0.9000 DESCRIPTION file has been updated so the package now depends       on R (>= 3.3.2) instead of  R (>= 3.3.3) as this lead to users who were using
     OS X Mavericks unable to use 'ecotox' as OS X Mavericks can only run R v3.3.2 and      less.
